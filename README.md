# .emacs.d

my second attempt at an emacs config

Improvements over [the previous one](https://github.com/BoogieMonster1O1/.emacs.d-old-0):
- Install packages from a list over committing the packages themselves
- Modularize the config (prevent a massive init.el)
- Only commit elisp config files rather than everything
- Actually understand what I'm doing
- Sign my commits
